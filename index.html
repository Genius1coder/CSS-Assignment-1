         <strong> My name is Mary. </strong> 
         I am an ardent lover of technology.
         <em> As a biochemical scientist,</em> 
         I am always on the lookout for the ways 
         through which technology can positively
        impact healthcare

        <p style="color:red ;"> <strong> Deciding to gain 
        web development skill is one of the best decisions
         I have made so far in my life </strong>. 
         Just within few weeks of getting into Stutern, 
         I have learn a great deal about <em> html and CSS. </em> 
         While html is the skeletal structure of web pages,
         CSS adds beauty to web pages, thus the two of them work together. </p>

          <p style="color:blue;"> <em> Padding, margin and border </em> 
          are some of the fundamental concepts of CSS. 
          <strong> Margin </strong> refers to the space around an element's 
          <strong>border </strong> while <strong> padding </strong> is the space between an 
          element's border and its contents. </p>
